# Hi I am Lukas

My research focuses on exploring psychological phenomena such as the impostor syndrome, stress, and personality traits, using quantitative methods to understand their interconnectedness. I investigate topics ranging from emotional regulation and psychohygiene to the impact of addiction on children and early indicators of dementia. My goal is to contribute valuable insights that can inform both academic knowledge and practical applications in mental health and social development.
